# How to get professional in OS? 
Awesome ‚Äî you're aiming at a **huge and rewarding goal**.  
Deep OS and Linux kernel knowledge is **one of the hardest but most powerful** skills in computer science.  
Let‚Äôs talk about the best way to *seriously* achieve this.

---

### Step 1: **Build Strong OS Fundamentals First**
You **cannot** skip the basics.  
Even if you want to dive into the Linux kernel, you *must* deeply understand:

- What a **process** and **thread** is
- **Memory management** (heap, stack, virtual memory, paging)
- **Filesystems** and how I/O works
- **Concurrency and synchronization** (locks, semaphores, deadlocks)
- **Scheduling** (how the OS decides who runs)
- **Interrupts** and **system calls**
- **Networking basics** (at the OS level)

üëâ **How to do this?**
- Read a good **Operating Systems textbook** *properly*:
  - üìò **"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" (OSTEP)** ‚Äî *best starter but serious book.*
  - üìò Then move to **"Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew Tanenbaum**.

---

### Step 2: **Write Mini Operating Systems Yourself**
**You must code** ‚Äî only reading won't get you real understanding.

üëâ **Projects to do**:
- **Write a tiny scheduler** (switch between fake processes)
- **Write your own malloc()/free()** (simulate memory management)
- **Write a simple filesystem** (in files, not disk yet)
- **Simulate virtual memory** (page tables, page replacement)
- **Write a very basic shell** (fork, exec, pipes, redirections)

If you want, I can suggest specific project plans for each.

---

### Step 3: **Start Studying the Linux Kernel**
Once you have **solid OS basics and experience**, now you're ready for Linux.

üëâ **How to approach the Linux Kernel?**
- Start with small parts:
  - **Process creation** (read how `fork()` works internally)
  - **Scheduling** (look at the Linux CFS scheduler)
  - **System call handling** (understand syscall table, and how syscalls happen)
  - **Memory management** (how Linux handles virtual memory, paging)
  - **Filesystem code** (like EXT4 or VFS layer)

- Read real source code:
  - Kernel source: [https://github.com/torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
  - Study one subsystem at a time.  
  Don't try to read everything randomly ‚Äî it's too huge.

- Use **LXR** (Linux Cross-Reference) to browse Linux code better:
  - Example: [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source)

---

### Step 4: **Hands-on: Modify and Rebuild the Kernel**
- Build and boot your own custom Linux kernel on a VM (like QEMU or VirtualBox)
- **Make small changes** (e.g., add a new system call, change scheduling parameters, add printk logs)
- Learn **kernel module programming** (write your own drivers or extensions)

üëâ For practice:
- Follow tutorials like "Linux Device Drivers" (by Jonathan Corbet)
- Write a small **kernel module** (e.g., a custom character device)

---

### Step 5: **Advanced Steps**
- Read **"Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love** ‚Äî *amazing book*.
- Follow **kernel mailing lists** (LKML) to see real discussions
- Solve real problems: pick simple kernel bugs and fix them.
- Maybe contribute to open source Linux projects related to kernel or drivers.

### Summary Plan
| Phase                  | Action                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Strong OS Fundamentals  | OSTEP + Tanenbaum + build mini OS projects |
| First Coding Projects   | Scheduler, Memory Manager, Shell, etc. |
| Linux Kernel Study      | Process, Scheduler, Memory, Filesystem |
| Kernel Hands-on         | Build, modify, write modules            |
| Advanced                | Read Love's book, follow LKML, contribute |

---

### Important Final Tip:
‚û°Ô∏è **Stay consistent, project-driven, and patient.**  
It usually takes **1 to 2 years** (serious study and projects) to become deeply skilled at OS + Linux kernel level.

Would you like me to **make a specific weekly/monthly learning plan** for you too? üìöüî•  
(Something like "Week 1-2: learn processes, Week 3-4: implement malloc," etc.)  
It can really help make it feel *structured* if you want. üöÄ
